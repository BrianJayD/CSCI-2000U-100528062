Part 2:
I produced the CSV file by copying and pasting the desired columns from the excel file into a new document.

I chose the size of the outbreaks by dividing the case with the largest case then multiplying it by 30 to produce a large enough radius to plot. There were some situations where some cases would not plot because the value was too low even when multiplied by 30, so I added 5 to each of the case radius' to ensure that each case will have atleast a radius of 5. This allows all points to be shown when plotted.
